## Stage 0 - Perón Solo (Corrupción 0)

```
Hi, im making a game for my friend that is a politic game about argentina. I will pass a patilla image.

Create a fullscreen background image (16:9, 1920x1080px minimum) in the style of a 1970s Argentine political propaganda poster, inspired by Soviet propaganda art but with Peronist identity.

SUBJECT: Juan Domingo Perón alone, full body or three-quarter portrait view. Perón should be:
- Age: Mid-60s (as he appeared in 1973-1974)
- Pose: Heroic, confident stance, one hand raised in a gesture of address or salute, or both hands at his sides in a powerful stance
- Expression: Serious, determined, charismatic, looking directly at camera or slightly upward
- Clothing: Classic Peronist attire - dark suit, white shirt, or military-style uniform jacket
- Position: Centered in the frame, occupying approximately 40-50% of the vertical space

COMPOSITION:
- Perón positioned in the center-left or center-right third of the frame (rule of thirds)
- Background: Abstract geometric patterns, rays of light emanating from behind Perón, or architectural elements suggesting power (columns, arches, or government buildings)
- Foreground: Subtle patriotic symbols - Argentine flag elements, sun symbol, or abstract shapes
- Depth: Perón in sharp focus, background slightly softer but still readable

LIGHTING:
- Key light: Strong directional light from upper left or right, creating dramatic shadows on Perón's face
- Rim light: Bright edge light on Perón's silhouette, creating separation from background
- Fill light: Minimal, allowing deep shadows for dramatic effect
- Color temperature: Warm golden hour tones mixed with cool shadows

COLORS:
- Primary: Deep red #c41e3a for accents, banners, or background elements
- Secondary: Dark blue #1e3a8a for shadows and depth
- Accent: Gold #fbbf24 for highlights, light rays, or symbolic elements
- Base: Dark background #0a0a0a with gradients

MOOD: Heroic, pristine, powerful, clean, uncorrupted. This is the "pure" state - no visual distortions, clean lines, perfect composition.

TEXTURE: Subtle film grain (1970s Kodak film stock aesthetic), slight paper texture overlay, vintage poster feel.

TECHNICAL: High contrast, sharp focus on Perón, colors slightly desaturated compared to later stages (saturation around 85%), brightness normal. The image should work when darkened by 5-10% and contrast increased by 5% via CSS filters.
```

## Stage 1 - Perón + Partido (Corrupción 1)

```
Hi, im making a game for my friend that is a politic game about argentina. I will pass a patilla image.

Create a fullscreen background image (16:9, 1920x1080px minimum) in the style of a 1970s Argentine political propaganda poster, inspired by Soviet propaganda art but with Peronist identity.

SUBJECT: Juan Domingo Perón with 3-5 political party members/entourage figures around him. Composition:
- Perón: Still the main focal point, positioned slightly forward, larger scale (occupies 35-40% of vertical space)
- Party members: 3-5 figures positioned behind and to the sides of Perón, slightly smaller scale, in supporting poses
- Group arrangement: Pyramid composition with Perón at the apex, or Perón in center with others flanking
- Poses: All figures in confident, unified poses - some with raised fists, some with hands on hearts, some pointing forward
- Expression: All serious, determined, looking forward or at Perón
- Clothing: Mix of suits, military-style jackets, some with Peronist symbols visible

COMPOSITION:
- Group positioned in center or center-left third of frame
- Background: More complex than Stage 0 - architectural elements, crowds in distance (blurred), banners, flags
- Foreground: More visual elements - banners, flags, geometric patterns
- Depth: Perón in sharpest focus, party members slightly softer, background more blurred

LIGHTING:
- Key light: Strong directional light from upper left, creating dramatic shadows
- Rim light: Bright edge light on all figures, especially Perón
- Fill light: Slightly more fill than Stage 0, but still dramatic shadows
- Color temperature: Warmer tones, more golden highlights

COLORS:
- Primary: Deep red #c41e3a more prominent - banners, flags, clothing accents
- Secondary: Dark blue #1e3a8a for depth and shadows
- Accent: Gold #fbbf24 for highlights, more gold elements than Stage 0
- Base: Dark background #0a0a0a with more complex gradients

MOOD: More intense, more dynamic, slightly more chaotic than Stage 0 but still organized and powerful. The presence of multiple figures adds visual complexity.

TEXTURE: Film grain slightly more pronounced, paper texture visible, vintage poster feel.

TECHNICAL: Higher contrast than Stage 0, colors more saturated (saturation around 90%), brightness slightly reduced (95% of Stage 0). The image should work when darkened by 8-12% and contrast increased by 8% via CSS filters.
```

## Stage 2 - Perón + Matías (Corrupción 2)

```
Hi, im making a game for my friend that is a politic game about argentina. I will pass a reference image of Matías (also known as Patilla).

Create a fullscreen background image (16:9, 1920x1080px minimum) in the style of a 1970s Argentine political propaganda poster, inspired by Soviet propaganda art but with Peronist identity.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENT - TWO PEOPLE MUST BE IN THIS IMAGE:
This image MUST contain TWO distinct people: Juan Domingo Perón AND Matías (the person in the reference image I'm providing). Both people must be clearly visible, recognizable, and prominent in the composition. Do NOT create an image with only Perón or only abstract figures.

REFERENCE IMAGE INSTRUCTIONS:
I will provide a reference image of Matías. You MUST study this reference image carefully and match Matías's exact appearance:
- Facial features: Match the exact face shape, eyes, nose, mouth, hair color, hair style, facial hair (if any) from the reference
- Body type: Match the body proportions, height, build from the reference
- Age: Matías appears to be a young adult (20s-30s) - match this age appearance
- Distinctive characteristics: Any unique features, glasses, clothing style, etc. from the reference
- Overall appearance: Matías should be instantly recognizable as the same person from the reference image

SUBJECT - TWO-FIGURE COMPOSITION:
This image MUST show TWO people together:

PERSON 1 - Juan Domingo Perón:
- Position: Left side of the frame, slightly forward/closer to camera
- Scale: Larger, occupies 30-35% of vertical space
- Age: Elderly man in his 60s (as he appeared in 1973-1974)
- Appearance: Classic Perón - gray/white hair, mustache, charismatic features
- Pose: Confident, powerful stance, one hand raised in gesture or at his side
- Expression: Serious, determined, charismatic, looking at camera
- Clothing: Classic Peronist attire - dark suit, white shirt, or military-style uniform jacket
- Role: Perón is the mentor/leader figure

PERSON 2 - Matías (from reference image):
- Position: Right side of the frame, slightly behind Perón but EQUALLY PROMINENT and VISIBLE
- Scale: Same size or slightly smaller than Perón, occupies 28-32% of vertical space
- Age: Young adult (20s-30s) - MUST match the age from reference image
- Appearance: MUST match the reference image exactly - same face, same features, same hair, same build
- Pose: Confident, powerful stance matching Perón's energy, both hands visible, standing tall
- Expression: Serious, determined, charismatic, looking at camera or at Perón
- Clothing: Modern casual clothing (t-shirt, hoodie, casual shirt, or modern jacket) - this creates visual contrast between the historical Perón and modern Matías
- Role: Matías is the young partner/protégé figure

INTERACTION BETWEEN THE TWO:
- They should be clearly interacting: shaking hands, both raising hands together in unified gesture, standing side-by-side with Perón's hand on Matías's shoulder, or both gesturing forward together
- Their poses should suggest partnership, collaboration, or mentorship
- Both should be looking at the camera or both looking at each other
- The interaction should be clear and visible - they are not separate figures, they are together

COMPOSITION - MUST SHOW TWO PEOPLE:
- Two-figure composition: Perón on left third, Matías on right third, OR both centered with space between them showing both clearly
- Both people MUST be fully visible - full body or three-quarter view, not cut off or hidden
- Background: More complex and dynamic - architectural elements, abstract patterns, rays of light connecting BOTH figures, symbolic elements suggesting partnership
- Visual connection: Use compositional elements (rays of light, banners, geometric lines) to visually connect Perón and Matías, showing they are together
- Foreground: Banners, flags, geometric patterns, or symbolic elements
- Depth: BOTH figures in sharp focus - Matías must be as sharp and clear as Perón, background softer but readable

LIGHTING:
- Key light: Strong directional light from upper center or upper left, illuminating both figures equally
- Rim light: Bright edge light on both figures, creating separation
- Fill light: Moderate fill, allowing dramatic shadows but keeping both faces visible
- Color temperature: Warm golden tones with cool shadows, more dynamic than previous stages

COLORS:
- Primary: Deep red #c41e3a very prominent - banners, clothing accents, background elements
- Secondary: Dark blue #1e3a8a for depth, shadows, and contrast
- Accent: Gold #fbbf24 for highlights, light rays, symbolic elements - more gold than previous stages
- Base: Dark background #0a0a0a with complex gradients and patterns

MOOD: Intense, dynamic, powerful partnership between two distinct people. More visual complexity than Stage 1. Colors are more saturated, shadows deeper, composition more dynamic. This represents a partnership/collaboration between the historical Perón and the modern Matías.

VERIFICATION CHECKLIST - BEFORE FINALIZING:
- [ ] TWO distinct people are clearly visible (Perón AND Matías)
- [ ] Matías matches the reference image exactly (face, features, age, build)
- [ ] Both people are prominent and equally visible (not one hidden or small)
- [ ] Both people are in sharp focus
- [ ] There is clear interaction between them (handshake, gesture, etc.)
- [ ] Perón looks like historical Perón (elderly, 60s, classic features)
- [ ] Matías looks like a young adult (20s-30s) matching the reference
- [ ] Visual contrast between historical Perón and modern Matías is clear

TEXTURE: Film grain more pronounced, paper texture visible, vintage poster feel with modern elements.

TECHNICAL: High contrast, colors highly saturated (saturation around 95%), brightness reduced (90% of Stage 0). BOTH figures must be clearly recognizable and prominent - Perón as the historical figure, Matías matching the reference image exactly. The image should work when darkened by 10-15% and contrast/saturation increased by 10% via CSS filters. If the AI generates an image with only one person or without Matías, regenerate until BOTH people are clearly present.
```

## Stage 3 - Corrupción Leve (Corrupción 3)

```
Hi, im making a game for my friend that is a politic game about argentina. I will pass a reference image of Matías (also known as Patilla).

Create a fullscreen background image (16:9, 1920x1080px minimum) in the style of a 1970s Argentine political propaganda poster, but CORRUPTED and DISTORTED.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENT - TWO PEOPLE MUST BE IN THIS IMAGE:
This image MUST contain TWO distinct people: Juan Domingo Perón AND Matías (the person in the reference image I'm providing). Both people must be clearly visible, recognizable, and prominent in the composition, but with VISIBLE but SUBTLE corruption effects applied to BOTH.

REFERENCE IMAGE INSTRUCTIONS:
I will provide a reference image of Matías. You MUST study this reference image carefully and match Matías's exact appearance (same as Stage 2):
- Facial features: Match the exact face shape, eyes, nose, mouth, hair color, hair style, facial hair (if any) from the reference
- Body type: Match the body proportions, height, build from the reference
- Age: Matías appears to be a young adult (20s-30s) - match this age appearance
- Distinctive characteristics: Any unique features, glasses, clothing style, etc. from the reference

SUBJECT - TWO-FIGURE COMPOSITION WITH CORRUPTION:
This image MUST show TWO people together (same composition as Stage 2), but with SUBTLE corruption effects:

PERSON 1 - Juan Domingo Perón (with subtle corruption):
- Position: Left side of the frame, slightly forward/closer to camera (same as Stage 2)
- Scale: Larger, occupies 30-35% of vertical space (same as Stage 2)
- Age: Elderly man in his 60s (as he appeared in 1973-1974)
- Appearance: Classic Perón - gray/white hair, mustache, charismatic features
- Pose: Same confident, powerful stance as Stage 2
- Expression: Same serious, determined expression but with subtle unease or distortion creeping in
- Clothing: Classic Peronist attire - dark suit, white shirt, or military-style uniform jacket
- Corruption effects: Subtle glitch artifacts, slight color shifts, minor warping on Perón

PERSON 2 - Matías (from reference image, with subtle corruption):
- Position: Right side of the frame, slightly behind Perón but EQUALLY PROMINENT and VISIBLE (same as Stage 2)
- Scale: Same size or slightly smaller than Perón, occupies 28-32% of vertical space (same as Stage 2)
- Age: Young adult (20s-30s) - MUST match the age from reference image
- Appearance: MUST match the reference image exactly - same face, same features, same hair, same build
- Pose: Same confident, powerful stance as Stage 2
- Expression: Same serious, determined expression but with subtle unease or distortion creeping in
- Clothing: Modern casual clothing (t-shirt, hoodie, casual shirt, or modern jacket) - same as Stage 2
- Corruption effects: Subtle glitch artifacts, slight color shifts, minor warping on Matías

INTERACTION BETWEEN THE TWO:
- Same interaction as Stage 2: shaking hands, both raising hands together, or Perón's hand on Matías's shoulder
- Their poses suggest partnership/collaboration (same as Stage 2)
- Both looking at camera or both looking at each other
- The interaction should be clear and visible

CORRUPTION EFFECTS (SUBTLE BUT VISIBLE):
Apply these effects to BOTH Perón AND Matías, and the entire composition, but keep them SUBTLE enough that both people are still clearly recognizable:
- Subtle glitch artifacts: Thin digital corruption lines (1-2 pixels wide) running vertically or horizontally across BOTH Perón's AND Matías's faces or bodies
- Chromatic aberration: Slight color fringing (red/cyan edges) on BOTH Perón's AND Matías's silhouettes, especially on high-contrast edges
- Slight warping: Minor distortion of facial features on BOTH people - eyes slightly misaligned, mouth slightly warped, but both still clearly recognizable (Perón as Perón, Matías matching the reference image)
- Color shifts: Subtle color shifts in shadows - red tints in some shadows, blue tints in others
- Double-exposure: Faint ghost images or double-exposure effects in some areas (especially edges)
- Overexposed highlights: Some highlights (especially rim light) creating halos or light bleeding

COMPOSITION - TWO PEOPLE WITH CORRUPTION:
- Base composition: Same two-figure composition as Stage 2 (Perón on left, Matías on right, or both centered), but elements are slightly misaligned or distorted
- Background: Same architectural/abstract elements as Stage 0/1, but with corruption:
  - Glitch lines running through background patterns
  - Color bleeding (colors bleeding into each other)
  - Distorted patterns (geometric shapes slightly warped)
  - Some elements duplicated or shifted
- Foreground: Elements breaking down:
  - Banners are torn or have glitch artifacts
  - Patterns are warped or misaligned
  - Flags have color bleeding or distortion
- Depth: Focus is slightly off - some areas sharper than they should be, creating visual unease
- Visual balance: Composition feels slightly off-balance, creating tension

LIGHTING:
- Key light: Same dramatic directional light as Stage 0/1, but with color shifts:
  - Red or blue tints in shadows (not uniform - some shadows red, some blue)
  - Light source feels slightly unstable or flickering
- Rim light: Harsh, overexposed edge light creating halos or color fringes:
  - Bright halos around Perón's silhouette (especially on edges)
  - Color fringing (red/cyan) on rim light edges
- Fill light: Uneven fill, creating strange shadow patterns:
  - Some areas darker than they should be
  - Shadow patterns don't match logically
- Color temperature: Mixed - warm and cool tones fighting each other (not harmonious)

COLORS:
- Primary: Deep red #c41e3a but bleeding into other colors, oversaturated (saturation 110-115%)
- Secondary: Dark blue #1e3a8a but with color shifts toward purple or green in some areas
- Accent: Gold #fbbf24 but harsh and overexposed in places, creating halos
- Base: Dark background #0a0a0a with color bleeding and distortion throughout
- Color harmony: Colors don't harmonize perfectly - slight discordance

MOOD: Darker, more ominous, unsettling. Things are starting to go wrong. The propaganda is decaying. Visual corruption is SUBTLE but PRESENT - you can still clearly recognize Perón and the propaganda poster aesthetic, but something feels off and wrong.

VISUAL EFFECTS CHECKLIST (ALL MUST BE PRESENT BUT SUBTLE):
- [ ] TWO people are clearly visible (Perón AND Matías)
- [ ] Matías matches the reference image exactly (face, features, age, build)
- [ ] Glitch artifacts visible on BOTH people (thin lines, digital corruption)
- [ ] Chromatic aberration on edges of BOTH people (color fringing)
- [ ] Slight warping/distortion of BOTH Perón's AND Matías's features
- [ ] Color bleeding (colors bleeding into each other)
- [ ] Double-exposure effects in some areas
- [ ] Overexposed highlights creating halos
- [ ] Color shifts in shadows (red/blue tints)
- [ ] Composition feels slightly off-balance
- [ ] BOTH Perón AND Matías are still clearly recognizable
- [ ] Propaganda poster aesthetic is maintained

TEXTURE: Film grain more pronounced and distorted (heavier grain than Stage 0/1), paper texture with tears or damage visible, vintage poster feel but decaying.

TECHNICAL: Very high contrast (higher than Stage 0/1/2), colors oversaturated (saturation around 110-115%), brightness reduced (85% of Stage 0), some areas overexposed creating halos. The corruption effects should be VISIBLE but NOT OVERWHELMING - you should still clearly recognize BOTH Perón AND Matías (Matías matching the reference image exactly). The image should work when darkened by 15-20% and contrast/saturation increased by 15% via CSS filters. If the AI generates an image with only one person or without Matías, regenerate until BOTH people are clearly present with corruption effects.
```

## Stage 4 - Colapso Furry (Corrupción 4-5)

```
Hi, im making a game for my friend that is a politic game about argentina. I will pass a reference image of Matías (also known as Patilla).

Create a fullscreen background image (16:9, 1920x1080px minimum) in the style of a 1970s Argentine political propaganda poster, but in COMPLETE VISUAL COLLAPSE and MAXIMUM CORRUPTION.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENT - TWO PEOPLE MUST BE IN THIS IMAGE:
This image MUST contain TWO distinct people: Juan Domingo Perón AND Matías (the person in the reference image I'm providing). Both people must be clearly visible, recognizable, and prominent in the composition, but with EXTREME and CHAOTIC corruption effects applied to BOTH.

REFERENCE IMAGE INSTRUCTIONS:
I will provide a reference image of Matías. You MUST study this reference image carefully and match Matías's exact appearance (same as Stage 2):
- Facial features: Match the exact face shape, eyes, nose, mouth, hair color, hair style, facial hair (if any) from the reference
- Body type: Match the body proportions, height, build from the reference
- Age: Matías appears to be a young adult (20s-30s) - match this age appearance
- Distinctive characteristics: Any unique features, glasses, clothing style, etc. from the reference

SUBJECT - TWO-FIGURE COMPOSITION WITH EXTREME CORRUPTION:
This image MUST show TWO people together (same composition as Stage 2/3), but with EXTREME corruption effects:

PERSON 1 - Juan Domingo Perón (with extreme corruption):
- Position: Left side of the frame, slightly forward/closer to camera (same as Stage 2/3)
- Scale: Larger, occupies 30-35% of vertical space (same as Stage 2/3)
- Age: Elderly man in his 60s (as he appeared in 1973-1974)
- Appearance: Classic Perón - gray/white hair, mustache, charismatic features
- Pose: Same confident, powerful stance as Stage 2/3, but distorted
- Expression: Distorted but still recognizable as Perón - features are warped, eyes might be glowing or distorted, mouth might be stretched or warped, but still Perón's face
- Clothing: Classic Peronist attire - dark suit, white shirt, or military-style uniform jacket
- Corruption effects: EXTREME glitch artifacts, severe warping, multiple exposure effects, chromatic aberration throughout, color inversion in areas, features melting or distorting

PERSON 2 - Matías (from reference image, with extreme corruption):
- Position: Right side of the frame, slightly behind Perón but EQUALLY PROMINENT and VISIBLE (same as Stage 2/3)
- Scale: Same size or slightly smaller than Perón, occupies 28-32% of vertical space (same as Stage 2/3)

- Appearance: MUST match the reference image exactly - same face, same features, same hair, same build (but distorted by corruption)
- Pose: Same confident, powerful stance as Stage 2/3, but distorted
- Expression: Distorted but still recognizable as Matías - features are warped, eyes might be glowing or distorted, mouth might be stretched or warped, but still Matías's face matching the reference
- Clothing: Modern casual clothing (t-shirt, hoodie, casual shirt, or modern jacket) - same as Stage 2/3
- Corruption effects: EXTREME glitch artifacts, severe warping, multiple exposure effects, chromatic aberration throughout, color inversion in areas, features melting or distorting

INTERACTION BETWEEN THE TWO:
- Same interaction as Stage 2/3: shaking hands, both raising hands together, or Perón's hand on Matías's shoulder
- Their poses suggest partnership/collaboration (same as Stage 2/3), but distorted by corruption
- Both looking at camera or both looking at each other
- The interaction should be clear and visible, though distorted

CORRUPTION EFFECTS (EXTREME AND CHAOTIC):
Apply ALL of these effects EXTENSIVELY to BOTH Perón AND Matías, and the entire composition:
- Extreme glitch artifacts: Thick digital corruption lines (3-5 pixels wide) running in multiple directions throughout BOTH Perón's AND Matías's faces and bodies, creating a "digital breakdown" effect
- Severe chromatic aberration: Heavy color fringing (red/cyan/green edges) on ALL edges of BOTH Perón's AND Matías's silhouettes and throughout the image
- Severe warping: Major distortion of facial features on BOTH people:
  - Perón: Eyes misaligned, stretched, or duplicated; mouth warped, stretched, or distorted; face shape distorted but still recognizable as Perón; body proportions warped
  - Matías: Eyes misaligned, stretched, or duplicated; mouth warped, stretched, or distorted; face shape distorted but still recognizable as Matías (matching reference image); body proportions warped
- Multiple exposure effects: Ghost images, triple-exposure effects, overlapping transparent versions of Perón
- Color inversion: Random areas of Perón's image inverted (negative effect) creating surreal patches
- Features melting/morphing: Edges of Perón's features appear to melt or morph into abstract shapes
- Surreal elements: Abstract shapes, distorted patterns, visual noise creeping into Perón's form
- Overexposed highlights: Extreme halos and light bleeding around Perón's silhouette
- Digital artifacts: Compression-like artifacts, pixelation in some areas, digital noise

COMPOSITION - TWO PEOPLE WITH EXTREME CORRUPTION:
- Base composition: Same two-figure composition as Stage 2/3 (Perón on left, Matías on right, or both centered), but COMPLETELY BREAKING DOWN:
  - Elements are severely misaligned, warped, or duplicated
  - Composition feels unstable and chaotic
  - Visual balance is completely broken
- Background: COMPLETE CHAOS:
  - Distorted patterns everywhere (geometric shapes unrecognizable)
  - Glitch lines running in all directions
  - Color bleeding throughout (colors bleeding into each other everywhere)
  - Abstract shapes emerging and merging with background
  - Elements duplicated, shifted, or inverted
- Foreground: Elements COMPLETELY BREAKING APART:
  - Banners are torn, distorted, and unrecognizable
  - Patterns are completely warped and abstract
  - Flags are distorted, colors bleeding everywhere
  - Surreal elements appearing and merging
- Depth: Focus is COMPLETELY BROKEN:
  - Some areas extremely sharp (unnaturally so)
  - Some areas extremely blurry
  - Creates visual chaos and unease
  - Multiple focal planes fighting each other

LIGHTING:
- Key light: Harsh, overexposed directional light creating EXTREME contrast:
  - Light source feels unstable, flickering, or multiple sources
  - Creates harsh shadows that don't make logical sense
- Rim light: EXTREME overexposed edge light:
  - Thick halos around Perón's silhouette (5-10 pixels wide)
  - Heavy color fringing (red/cyan/green) on rim light edges
  - Light bleeding into surrounding areas
- Fill light: COMPLETELY CHAOTIC:
  - Uneven fill creating strange, illogical shadow patterns
  - Some areas completely dark, some overexposed
  - Shadows don't match the light sources
- Color temperature: COMPLETELY BROKEN:
  - Warm and cool tones fighting violently
  - Color shifts throughout (red shifts, blue shifts, green shifts)
  - No color harmony whatsoever

COLORS:
- Primary: Deep red #c41e3a but EXTREMELY oversaturated (saturation 120-130%), bleeding everywhere, inverted in random areas
- Secondary: Dark blue #1e3a8a but shifted toward purple, green, cyan, or other colors throughout
- Accent: Gold #fbbf24 but harsh, overexposed, creating thick halos and light bleeding
- Base: Dark background #0a0a0a but with EXTENSIVE color bleeding and distortion throughout
- Color harmony: COMPLETELY BROKEN - colors clash violently, creating visual chaos

MOOD: Dark, chaotic, nightmarish, apocalyptic. The propaganda has COMPLETELY COLLAPSED. Visual corruption is EXTREME - you can still recognize it as Perón and propaganda (just barely), but it's breaking down into complete visual chaos and surrealism. This is the "furry collapse" stage - think of it as propaganda that has been corrupted to the point of surrealism and visual breakdown. The corruption should suggest surrealism, extreme distortion, and complete visual collapse - artistic and thematic, not literal furry content.

VISUAL EFFECTS CHECKLIST (ALL MUST BE PRESENT AND EXTREME):
- [ ] TWO people are clearly visible (Perón AND Matías)
- [ ] Matías matches the reference image exactly (face, features, age, build) - even with extreme corruption
- [ ] Extreme glitch artifacts throughout on BOTH people (thick lines, digital corruption)
- [ ] Severe chromatic aberration everywhere on BOTH people (heavy color fringing)
- [ ] Severe warping/distortion of BOTH Perón's AND Matías's features (but both still recognizable)
- [ ] Color bleeding throughout (colors bleeding everywhere)
- [ ] Multiple exposure effects (ghost images, triple exposures) on BOTH people
- [ ] Overexposed highlights creating thick halos around BOTH people
- [ ] Color inversion in random areas on BOTH people
- [ ] Surreal elements (abstract shapes, distorted patterns)
- [ ] Melting/morphing effects on edges of BOTH people
- [ ] Digital artifacts and compression-like effects throughout
- [ ] Composition feels completely unstable
- [ ] BOTH Perón AND Matías are still recognizable (just barely)
- [ ] Propaganda poster aesthetic is present but breaking down

TEXTURE: HEAVY film grain (very pronounced), distorted and damaged paper texture (tears, burns, decay), vintage poster feel but COMPLETELY decayed and corrupted.

TECHNICAL: MAXIMUM contrast (extreme), colors EXTREMELY oversaturated (saturation around 120-130%), brightness heavily reduced (75% of Stage 0), many areas overexposed or underexposed creating extreme contrast. The corruption should be EXTREME but BOTH Perón AND Matías should still be RECOGNIZABLE (just barely) - Matías matching the reference image exactly, Perón as Perón. It's propaganda that has collapsed into visual chaos and surrealism. The image should work when heavily darkened by 20-25% and contrast/saturation increased by 20% via CSS filters, plus multiply blend mode applied. If the AI generates an image with only one person or without Matías, regenerate until BOTH people are clearly present with extreme corruption effects.

## Abuela Cuetes (Imagen Especial)

```
Hi, im making a game for my friend that is a politic game about argentina. I will pass a patilla image.

Create a fullscreen background image (16:9, 1920x1080px minimum) in the style of a 1970s Argentine political propaganda poster, but for a humorous/absurd subject.

CRITICAL: This image shows an elderly Argentine grandmother (abuela) as the MAIN SUBJECT, with FIREWORKS (cuetes) as the PRIMARY VISUAL ELEMENT creating drama and color. The abuela should be clearly visible and prominent, with fireworks exploding around her.

SUBJECT - ABUELA (MAIN FOCUS):
- Abuela: Elderly Argentine grandmother, age 70-80s
- Appearance: Typical Argentine grandmother features:
  - Short gray or white hair (styled simply, typical abuela haircut)
  - Glasses (reading glasses or regular glasses)
  - Warm but determined facial features
  - Slight smile or serious expression (propaganda-style)
- Clothing: Simple, typical abuela attire:
  - Simple dress (floral pattern or solid color)
  - OR cardigan/sweater with blouse underneath
  - OR apron over dress (suggesting she was cooking/baking)
  - Colors: Muted colors (beiges, grays, light blues) to contrast with bright fireworks
- Pose: Heroic, confident stance (like propaganda):
  - OPTION 1: One hand raised high, holding a lit firework (cuete) that's about to explode
  - OPTION 2: Both hands raised, holding multiple fireworks (some lit, some unlit)
  - OPTION 3: Standing confidently with arms at sides or one hand on hip, while fireworks explode around her
  - Stance should be powerful and confident (like a propaganda hero)
- Expression: Serious and determined (like propaganda), but the absurdity comes from the context (fireworks), not the expression itself
- Position: Centered in frame or center-left third, occupying 40-50% of vertical space
- Scale: Abuela should be LARGE and PROMINENT - she is the main subject

FIREWORKS - CRITICAL VISUAL ELEMENT:
Fireworks (cuetes) are the PRIMARY VISUAL DRAMA and COLOR SOURCE:
- Quantity: MULTIPLE fireworks (at least 5-10 visible fireworks)
- Types: Mix of different firework types:
  - Roman candles (held or shooting upward)
  - Sparklers (held in hands)
  - Firecrackers (exploding on ground or in air)
  - Aerial fireworks (exploding in the sky above)
- Colors: BRIGHT and COLORFUL explosions:
  - Yellow #ffd700 (bright gold/yellow)
  - Orange #ff8c00 (bright orange)
  - Red #ff0000 (bright red)
  - Blue #0066ff (bright blue)
  - Green #00ff00 (bright green)
  - White #ffffff (bright white flashes)
- Light effects: Fireworks creating DRAMATIC light effects:
  - Bright flashes illuminating the scene
  - Trails of light (motion blur showing firework paths)
  - Sparks and embers flying everywhere
  - Light trails creating dynamic lines in the composition
- Placement: Fireworks should be:
  - Some held by the abuela (in her hands)
  - Some exploding in the air around her (above, to the sides, behind)
  - Some on the ground exploding (creating depth)
  - Creating a "halo" or "explosion" effect around the abuela
- Light from fireworks: Should illuminate the abuela's face and create dramatic rim lighting:
  - Warm golden/yellow light on her face from nearby fireworks
  - Colorful rim light on her silhouette from explosions
  - Colorful shadows created by firework light

COMPOSITION:
- Abuela: Positioned in center or center-left third of frame (rule of thirds)
- Background: Dark night sky or abstract dark background (#0a0a0a):
  - Allows fireworks to stand out dramatically
  - Can have subtle stars or city lights in distance (blurred)
  - Dark enough to make fireworks pop
- Foreground: Fireworks exploding:
  - Some fireworks in foreground (creating depth)
  - Motion blur on fast-moving fireworks
  - Sparks and embers in foreground
- Depth: Abuela in SHARP FOCUS (she is the main subject):
  - Fireworks creating depth with motion blur and light trails
  - Some fireworks sharp, some blurred (creating depth)
  - Foreground fireworks slightly blurred, background fireworks sharp or blurred

LIGHTING:
- Key light: Fireworks creating dramatic, colorful directional light:
  - Main light source: Fireworks held by abuela or exploding nearby
  - Warm golden/yellow light illuminating abuela's face
  - Colorful light (red, blue, green) from different fireworks
- Rim light: Bright edge light from fireworks on abuela's silhouette:
  - Colorful rim light (different colors from different fireworks)
  - Creates separation from dark background
- Fill light: Fireworks providing fill light:
  - Multiple fireworks creating fill light from different angles
  - Colorful shadows (not just gray shadows, but colored shadows)
- Color temperature: Warm golden tones from nearby fireworks mixed with cool night tones and colorful firework light

COLORS:
- Primary: Deep red #c41e3a for propaganda elements (banners, flags if present), but FIREWORKS add bright colors
- Secondary: Dark blue #1e3a8a for night sky and shadows
- Accent: Gold #fbbf24 and BRIGHT firework colors:
  - Yellow #ffd700 (bright gold/yellow)
  - Orange #ff8c00 (bright orange)
  - Red #ff0000 (bright red)
  - Blue #0066ff (bright blue)
  - Green #00ff00 (bright green)
  - White #ffffff (bright white flashes)
- Base: Dark background #0a0a0a (night sky) with BRIGHT firework colors exploding
- Abuela's clothing: Muted colors (beiges, grays, light blues) to contrast with bright fireworks

MOOD: Epic, dramatic, cinematic, but absurd and humorous. Like a propaganda poster but for something ridiculous (grandmother with fireworks). The composition should be SERIOUS and EPIC (like propaganda), but the subject matter (abuela with fireworks) creates humor through absurdity. The abuela should look like a propaganda hero, but she's holding/standing with fireworks.

VISUAL EFFECTS:
- Bright firework explosions creating light trails and motion blur:
  - Trails of light showing firework paths
  - Motion blur on fast-moving fireworks
- Sparks and embers from fireworks:
  - Small sparks flying everywhere
  - Embers glowing and falling
- Dramatic light effects from explosions:
  - Bright flashes illuminating the scene
  - Light bleeding into surrounding areas
- Colorful light illuminating the scene:
  - Different colored light from different fireworks
  - Colorful shadows and highlights

TEXTURE: Film grain (1970s Kodak film stock aesthetic - subtle), paper texture (vintage poster feel), vintage poster aesthetic.

TECHNICAL: High contrast (dramatic), bright and colorful (fireworks should POP and be the brightest elements), saturation high (around 100-110% for fireworks, normal for abuela), brightness normal to bright (fireworks should be BRIGHT, abuela normally lit). The image should work as a fullscreen background with fireworks creating a dynamic, colorful, cinematic scene. The abuela should be clearly visible and recognizable (sharp focus), with fireworks as the main visual drama creating color and light.
